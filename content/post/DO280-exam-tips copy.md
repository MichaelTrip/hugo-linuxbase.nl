Intro
-----

I passed the DO280 Exam last week. Some tips:
## Learning matters

Use the official openshift material from Redhat.

## Create your own .vimrc

If you use vim as your favorite editor, it is important to use the right configuration. You can edit your `.vimrc` in your home folder. I used the following settings:

```
set nu # set numbers
set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 expandtab # use 2 spaces instead of tab
set ai # autoindent: when go to new line keep same indentation
set cursorcolumn # You see a column on your cursor so you can easily check the identation.
```

## Some other tips

### Stay hydrated

You are allowed to have a glass or a bottle of water next to you. Mind that this bottle or glass needs to be transparent.

### Clean up your desk before taking the exam

I started the exam 15 minutes before and cleaned up my desk. But, i left my audio speakers on the desk. The proctor asked me to also remove these audio speakers. So please, clean up your desk and remove everything from your desk besides your keyboard, mouse and your laptop.

### Check your questions before you begin

Go through all the questions and begin with the easiest ones first. After that, you have plenty of time to start with the hard questions.

### Check in which context you have to use

At the beginning of every question, it states in which context you will work in. There is also a copy button with to command that you can use. Use this button, it will save you a lot of time.
